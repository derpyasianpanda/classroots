# Classroots
An open learning web app for Hack'20 (Hosted by DubHacks)

The site is live at http://classroots.herokuapp.com/

## Inspiration
With school campuses reopening for fall and COVID-19 cases still on the rise, thousands of parents have begun scrambling to organize home or hybrid-schooling for their children as a safer alternative. Unfortunately, this can be an overwhelming and isolating experience for both parent and child. This is especially true for families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who may not have access to paid resources like private tutoring. Classroots was designed to address parent needs for forming supplemental learning and social groups for their kids and reduce the equity gap in education through its free and community-powered platform.

## What it Does
Classroots allows parents of homeschooled or hybrid-schooled students K-6 to connect to discuss curriculum and education opportunities for their children. They can connect through things like shared locations, interests, or educational styles.

## How We Built it
We created the front-end with React and the backend with Express, using Firebase to handle database transactions.

We also used passportJS for user authentication and authorization
