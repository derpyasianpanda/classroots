Firebase for our backend and keep on using React for the frontend. Check out the

## Inspiration
With school campuses reopening for fall and COVID-19 cases still on the rise,
thousands of parents have begun scrambling to organize home or hybrid-schooling
for their children as a safer alternative. Unfortunately, this can be an overwhelming
and isolating experience for both parent and child. This is especially true for
families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who may not have access to paid
resources like private tutoring. Classroots was designed to address parent needs
for forming supplemental learning and social groups for their kids and reduce the
equity gap in education through its free and community-powered platform.

## What it Does
Classroots allows parents of homeschooled or hybrid-schooled students K-6 to connect
to discuss curriculum and education opportunities for their children. They can
connect through things like shared locations, interests, or educational styles.

## How We Built it
We created the front-end with React and used Firebase to handle the backend
